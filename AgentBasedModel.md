# Assignment One- An agent based model
---
## Brief overview of ABM's
Agent Based Models (ABM’s) are a very popular computational modelling technique with a wide variety of applications, from real- world business problems to theory in the social/ ecological sciences. In its simplest form, an ABM represents a system as a collection of individual actors, the interactions between them, with and in an environment. These interactions can be called ‘emergent phenomena’ and are a key benefit of san ABM  (Bonabeau, 2002). The rise of object orientated programming has meant that ABM’s have become relatively simple to implement, whether abstract or real. 

## My ABM
For information on how to run the model and what to expect please see the [Read Me](https://github.com/gladyskenyon/Agent-Based-Model/blob/main/README.md)
