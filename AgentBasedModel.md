# Assignment One- An agent based model
---
## Brief overview of ABM's
Agent Based Models (ABM’s) are a very popular computational modelling technique with a wide variety of applications, from real- world business problems to theory in the social/ ecological sciences. In its simplest form, an ABM represents a system as a collection of autonomous actors, the interactions between them, with and in an environment. The rise of object orientated programming has meant that ABM’s have become relatively simple to implement, whether abstract or real. One of the key benefits of ABM's are their ability to capture ‘emergent phenomena’, which are a result of agent interactions (Bonabeau, 2002). 

## My ABM
For information on how to run the model and what to expect please see the [Read Me](https://github.com/gladyskenyon/Agent-Based-Model/blob/main/README.md).
To access the  final scripts see the github repository [here](https://github.com/gladyskenyon/Agent-Based-Model). 

This is a screen shot after the model has run:
