# PhD Project
My project will become my main focus after I finish my MSc and ideas are still developing.
## The Title: Hedonic pricing models based on Machine Learning
My project is partnered with [Idealista](https://www.idealista.com/en/), a property company which operates in Spain, Portugal and Italy.
I am starting to gather and read relevant literature.
