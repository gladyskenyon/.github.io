Hello and welcome to my academic website! My name is Gladys, I'm 21 years old and I was born in Sheffield (UK). I have created this site as I begin my journey as a post-grad student.

I am a integrated Msc/PhD student on a [ESRC funded CDT Programme](https://datacdt.org/) called Data Analytics and Society. I am part of the [Geographic Data Science Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/) at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/). 

As part of my MsC I am taking modules at the University of Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield. My first assignment is for the Leeds module: [Programming for Social Science: Core Skills](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/), my work is detailed under the AgentBasedModel tab below.
